Reactive MVVM Experiment
------------------------

Let's be honest. As I write this (i.e. before coding, while `pod install` does its thing) I don't really know what I'm doing here. For the sake of argument, let's assume that by the time you read this (i.e. it's on GitHub) I finally do. File an issue and I'll update this that I'm now competent ;).

Installing
==========

```
pod install
open ReactiveMVVMExperiment.xcworkspace
```

Boom.

Thanks

It's an understatement to say this was inspired by https://github.com/jspahrsummers/GroceryList. I've used a lot of the framework/structure (base classes, general architecture, etc). It's no surprise..they know what they're doing :)
